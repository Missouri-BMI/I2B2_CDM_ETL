However, counties change over time (which impacts our derived variables such as poverty code indicator which don’t directly align with year of diagnosis), and the county reported by the facility does not always match the geocoded county. In the vast majority of cases where geocoded county and reported county differ, the geocoded county is correct. Including additional geocoded county codes for each census year addresses the accuracy of geocoded fields, however, it is cumbersome to pull data from different variables in order to generate county-level rates. Use of this variable ensures the most accurate and appropriate county data is used for calculating county-level rates.

As noted in the Text--Usual Occupation \[310\] section, in those situations where the usual occupation is not available or is unknown, the patient’s current or most recent occupation is recorded, if available.

380,Sequence Number--Central,2,SEER,"A,C,I,M",Cancer Identification,sequenceNumberCentral,Tumor,,,,,R,.,R,D,"Code indicates the sequence of all reportable neoplasms over the lifetime of the person. This data item differs from Sequence Number-Hospital \[560\], because the definitions of reportable neoplasms often vary between a hospital and a central registry. Each neoplasm is assigned a different number. Sequence Number 00 indicates that the person has had only one _in situ_ or one malignant neoplasm as defined by the Federal reportable list (regardless of central registry reference date). Sequence Number 01 indicates the first of two or more reportable neoplasms, but 02 indicates the second of two or more reportable neoplasms, and so on. Because the time period of Sequence Number is a person’s lifetime, reportable neoplasms not included in the central registry (those that occur outside the registry catchment area or before the reference date) also are allotted a sequence number. For example, a registry may contain a single record for a patient with a sequence number of 02 because the first reportable neoplasm preceded the central registry’s reference date. 

**Reporting Requirements: Federally Required and State/Province Defined** 

The Federal or SEER/NPCR standard defining the reportable neoplasms is described in, [**Standards For Tumor Inclusion and Reportability**](https://apps.naaccr.org/data-dictionary/data-dictionary/version=24/chapter-view/standards-for-tumor-inclusion-and-reportability/)**.** It is assumed that this shared standard is the “minimum” definition of reportability. Individual central cancer registries may define additional neoplasms as reportable.

Numeric codes in the 00-59 range indicate the sequence of neoplasms of _in situ_ or malignant behavior (2 or 3) at the time of diagnosis, which SEER/NPCR standards require to be reported. Codes 60 to 87 indicate the sequence of non-malignant tumors (as defined in [**Standards For Tumor Inclusion and Reportability**](https://apps.naaccr.org/data-dictionary/data-dictionary/version=24/chapter-view/standards-for-tumor-inclusion-and-reportability/)**.**) and any other neoplasms that the central registry has defined as reportable. Neoplasms required by SEER/NPCR with an _in situ_ or malignant behavior at the time of diagnosis are sequenced completely independently of this higher-numbered category. Sequence Number-Hospital does not affect Sequence Number-Central. The two notational systems are independent but central registries should take Sequence Number-Hospital \[560\] into account when coding Sequence Number Central.","The purpose of sequencing based on the patient’s lifetime is to truly identify the 00s, the people who only had one malignant primary in their lifetimes for survival analysis. If a central registry sequences by just what is reported to them, then it will be unclear whether 00 means the person only had one malignant primary in his lifetime or the person had one malignant primary since the central registry started collecting data. The Federally required reportable list has changed throughout the years, so the registry must use the appropriate reportable list for the year of diagnosis. The central registry reference date will not affect Sequence Number-Central.",,,**Codes**,"00-59, 60-87, 88, 98, 99","Right justified, zero filled",digits,"The table that follows shows which sequence number series to use by type of neoplasm.

Some reporting facilities (e.g., VA, DoD, interstate exchange) have restrictions about when the receiving central registry is allowed to release of data reported by their facility. Often times these restrictions depend on the agreements between the central registry and the reporting facility and focus on patient contact studies, research, and certain other types of studies that involve release of PII.

It is essential to have a standard way for central registries to identify and exclude potentially non-releasable records from a file that is transmitted to external parties for purposes other than routine surveillance. Currently, there is no standard data item to flag records that are potentially non-releasable based on the reporting facility and the methods to identify these records differ between registries.

Code 00: This code is assigned if the tumor record is only reported by a facility without potential restrictions on release of data (e.g., in-state hospital, physician offices, pathology lab). The code is also assigned if the tumor record is reported by both a facility without restrictions and a facility listed below that potentially has restrictions. For example, if an in-state hospital and a VHA facility both report the same tumor, code 00 would be assigned upon consolidation.

Allowable release:

Code 00: These records can be released; however, the type of information released will depend on a registry’s policies/procedures/legislation/administrative rules.

Codes 01-07: These records can be released, without permission from the reporting facility(ies), in these specific instances:

*   Release for routine national surveillance activities (e.g., reporting to NCI, CDC, and NAACCR)
*   Release of PII for public health surveillance activities (e.g., linkage for routine registry operations, use in cancer concern investigations, etc.)
*   Release of a limited data set to researchers conducting linkage studies (e.g., cohort ID plus cancer information)
*   Release of de-identified data

Limitations on external release of PII for research:

Code 00: Release of PII depends on a registry’s internal policies/procedures/legislation/administrative rules.

Codes 01-07: Release of PII is dependent on a registry’s agreements with the reporting facility(ies) and is generally handled as follows:

Codes 01-03 (records received from single reporting facility) may require that the registry seek permission from original reporting facility when PII is released.

Adapted from <http://seer.cancer.gov/causespecific/>:  
Cause-specific survival is a net survival measure representing survival of a specified cause of death in the absence of other causes of death. Estimates are calculated by specifying the cause of death. Individuals who die of causes other than the specified cause are considered to be censored. This requires a cause of death variable that accurately captures all causes related to the specific cause. Vital records offices use algorithms to process causes of death from death certificates in order to identify a single, disease-specific, underlying cause of death. In some cases, attribution of a single cause of death may be difficult and misattribution may occur. For example a death may be attributed to the site of metastasis instead of the primary site.  
  
To capture deaths related to the specific cancer but not coded as such, the SEER cause-specific death classification variables are defined by taking into account causes of deaths in conjunction with tumor sequence (i.e., only one tumor or the first of subsequent tumors), site of the original cancer diagnosis, and comorbidities (e.g., AIDS and/or site-related diseases).  
  
The 'SEER cause-specific death classification' variable is used to obtain cancer-specific survival probability for a given cohort of cancer patients. Deaths attributed to the cancer of interest are treated as events and deaths from other causes are treated as censored observation. This variable is used in SEER\*Stat cause-specific survival and crude probability of death using cause of death information.","These changes will benefit the cancer surveillance community by facilitating the application of standard methods for survival analysis.

**Over-ride Flag as Used in the EDITS Software Package**

Multiple versions of edits of the type Primary Site, Morphology-Type check for ""usual"" combinations of site and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology. The SEER version of the edit is more restrictive than the CoC edit, and thus, uses a different over-ride flag. The CoC version of the edit will accept Over-ride CoC Site/Type or Over-ride Site/Type (the SEER edit) as equivalent.

The Site/Histology validation list (available on the SEER web site) contains those histologies commonly found in the specified primary site. Histologies that occur only rarely or never are not included. These edits require review of all combinations not listed.

Since basal and squamous cell carcinomas of non-genital skin sites are not reportable to SEER, these site/histology combinations do not appear on the SEER validation list. For the CoC version of the edit, if primary site is in the range C440-C449 (skin), and ICD-O-2 histology is in the range 8000-8004 (neoplasms, malignant, NOS), 8010-8045 (epithielial carcinomas), 8050-8082 (papillary and squamous cell carcinomas), or 8090-8110 (basal cell carcinomas), or ICD-O-3 histology is in the range 8000-8005 (neoplasms, malignant, NOS), 8010-8046 (epithelial carcinomas), 8050-8084 (papillary and squamous cell carcinomas), or 8090-8110 (basal cell carcinomas), no further editing is done. No over-ride is necessary for these cases in the CoC version of the edit.

Review of these cases requires investigating whether the combination is biologically plausible or whether cancer registry coding conventions would allow different codes for the diagnosis. Review of these rare combinations often results in a change to either the site or histology.

Edits of the type Seq Num--Hosp, Primary Site, Morph differ in use of ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 morphology. They force review of multiple primary cancers when one of the primaries is coded to a site/morphology combination that could indicate a metastatic site rather than a primary site.

1.    If Sequence Number--Hospital indicates the person has had more than one primary, then any case with one of the following site/histology combinations requires review:
    *   C760-C768 (ill-defined sites) or C809 (unknown primary) and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology less than 9590. Look for evidence that the unknown or ill-defined primary is a secondary site from one of the patient's other cancers. For example, a clinical discharge diagnosis of ""abdominal carcinomatosis"" may be attributable to the patient’s primary ovarian cystadenocarcinoma already in the registry, and should not be entered as a second primary.
    *   C770-C779 (lymph nodes) and ICD-O-2 histology not in range 9590-9717 or ICD-O-3 histology not in the range 9590-9729; or C420-C424 and ICD-O-2 histology not in range 9590-9941 or ICD-O-3 histology not in the range 9590-9989. That combination is most likely a metastatic lesion. Check whether the lesion could be a manifestation of one of the patient’s other cancers.
    *   Any site and ICD-O-2 histology in the range 9720-9723, 9740-9741 or ICD-O-3 histology in the range 9740-9758. Verify that these diagnoses are coded correctly and are indeed separate primaries from the others
2.    If it turns out that the suspect tumor is a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers, delete the metastatic or secondary case, re-sequence remaining cases, and correct the coding on the original case as necessary.

Multiple versions of edits of the type Primary site, Morphology-Type check for ""usual"" combinations of site and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology. The SEER version of the edit is more restrictive than the CoC edit, and thus uses a different over-ride flag. The CoC version of the edit will accept Over-ride CoC-Site/Type or Over-ride Site/Type as equivalent.

1.  The Site/Histology validation list (available on the SEER web site) contains those histologies commonly found in the specified primary site. Histologies that occur only rarely or never are not included. These edits require review of all combinations not listed.
2.  Since basal and squamous cell carcinomas of non-genital skin sites are not reportable to SEER, these site/histology combinations do not appear on the SEER validation list. For the CoC version of the edit, if Primary Site is in the range C440-C449 (skin), and ICD-O-2 histology is in the range 8000-8004 (neoplasms, malignant, NOS), 8010-8045 (epithelial carcinomas), 8050-8082 (papillary and squamous cell carcinomas), or 8090-8110 (basal cell carcinomas), or ICD-O-3 histology is in the range 8000-8005 (neoplasms, malignant, NOS), 8010-8046 (epithelial carcinomas), 8050-8084 (papillary and squamous cell carcinomas), or 8090-8110 (basal cell carcinomas), no further editing is done. No over-ride is necessary for these cases in the CoC version of the edit.

Review of these cases requires investigating whether a) the combination is biologically implausible, or b) there are cancer registry coding conventions that would dictate different codes for the diagnosis. Review of these rare combinations often results in changes to the primary site and/or morphology, rather than a decision that the combination is correct.

**Over-ride Flags as Used in the EDITS Software Package**

Edits of the type Diagnostic Confirmation, Behavior differ in the use of ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 and check that, for _in situ_ cases (Behavior = 2), Diagnostic Confirmation specifies microscopic confirmation (1, 2, or 4).

The distinction between _in situ_ and invasive is very important to a registry, since prognosis is so different. Since the determination that a neoplasm has not invaded surrounding tissues, i.e., _in situ_, is made microscopically, cases coded _in situ_ in behavior should have a microscopic confirmation code. However, very rarely, a physician will designate a case noninvasive or _in situ_ without microscopic evidence.

If an edit of the type, Diagnostic Confirmation, Behavior, gives an error message or warning, check that Behavior and Diagnostic Confirmation have been coded correctly. Check carefully for any cytologic or histologic evidence that may have been missed in coding.

Edits of the type, Morphology--Type/Behavior, perform the following check:

1.  Codes listed in ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 with behavior codes of only 0 or 1 are considered valid, since the behavior matrix of ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3 allows for the elevation of the behavior of such histologies when the tumor is _in situ_ or malignant. This edit forces review of these rare cases to verify that they are indeed _in situ_ or malignant.
2.  The following histologies are generally not accepted as _in situ_: ICD-O-2 histologies 8000-8004, 8020, 8021, 8331, 8332, 8800-9054, 9062, 9082, 9083, 9110-9491, 9501-9989, ICD-O-3 histologies 8000-8005, 8020, 8021, 8331, 8332, 8800-9055, 9062, 9082, 9083, 9110-9493, 9501-9989. This edit forces review of these cases.
3.  If a Morphology-Type/Behavior edit produces an error or warning message and the case is one in which the 4-digit morphology code is one that appears in ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 only with behavior codes of 0 or 1, or the case is one in which the 4-digit morphology code is not generally accepted with a behavior code of 2, verify the coding of morphology and that the behavior should be coded malignant or _in situ_. The registrar may need to consult a pathologist or medical advisor in problem cases.
    *   Exceptions:
    *   If year of Date of Diagnosis > 2000, then a behavior code of 1 is valid for the following ICD-O-2 histologies and no over-ride flag is needed: 8931, 9393, 9538, 9950, 9960-9962, 9980-9984, and 9989. Similarly, the following ICD-O-3 histologies are valid with a behavior code of 1: 8442, 8451, 8462, 8472, and 8473. If year of Date of Diagnosis > 2003, the following ICD-O-3 benign histologies will pass without review: 8146, 8271, 8861, 8897, 9121, 9122, 9131, 9161, 9350, 9351, 9352, 9360, 9361, 9383, 9384, 9394, 9412, 9413, 9444, 9492, 9493, 9506, 9531, 9532, 9533, 9534, 9537, 9541, 9550, 9562, and 9570.
4.  Grade 5-8 with histologies not in the range of 9590-9948 is impossible.
5.  Some terms in ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3 carry an implied statement of grade. These histologies must be reported with the correct grade as stated below. An error of this type cannot be over-ridden.

Edits of the type Seq Num--Central, Primary Site, Morph differ in use of ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 morphology. They force review of multiple primary cancers when one of the primaries is coded to a site/morphology combination that could indicate a metastatic site rather than a primary site.

1.  If Sequence Number-Central indicates the person has had more than one primary, then any case with one of the following site/histology combinations requires review:
    *   C760-C768 (ill-defined sites) or C809 (unknown primary) and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology \< 9590. Look for evidence that the unknown or ill-defined primary is a secondary site from one of the patient’s other cancers. For example, a clinical discharge diagnosis of “abdominal carcinomatosis” may be attributable to the patient’s primary ovarian cystadenocarcinoma already in the registry, and should not be entered as a second primary.
    *   C770-C779 (lymph nodes) and ICD-O-2 histology not in the range 9590-9717 or ICD-O-3 histology not in the range 9590-9729; or C420-C424 and ICD-O-2 histology not in the range 9590-9941 or ICD-O-3 histology not in the range 9590-9989. That combination is most likely a metastatic lesion. Check whether the lesion could be a manifestation of one of the patient’s other cancers.
    *   Any site and ICD-O-2 histology in the range 9720-9723, 9740-9741 or ICD-O-3 histology in the range 9740-9758. Verify that these diagnoses are coded correctly and are indeed separate primaries from the others.
2.  If it turns out that the suspect tumor is a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers, delete the metastatic or secondary case, re-sequence remaining cases, and correct the coding on the original case as necessary.

**Over-ride Flag as Used in the EDITS Software Package**

Edits of the type, Primary Site, Behavior Code, require review of the following primary sites with a behavior of _in situ_ (ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 behavior = 2):

*   C269                Gastrointestinal tract, NOS
*   C399                Ill-defined sites within respiratory system

*   C759                Endocrine gland, NOS
*   C760-C768      Ill-defined sites
*   C809                Unknown primary site

Since the designation of _in situ_ is very specific and almost always requires microscopic confirmation, ordinarily specific information should also be available regarding the primary site. Conversely, if inadequate information is available to determine a specific primary site, it is unlikely that information about a cancer being _in situ_ is reliable.

If an _in situ_ diagnosis is stated, try to obtain a more specific primary site. A primary site within an organ system can sometimes be identified based on the diagnostic procedure or treatment given or on the histologic type. If no more specific site can be determined, it is usually preferable to code a behavior code of 3. In the exceedingly rare situation in which it is certain that the behavior is _in situ_ and no more specific site code is applicable, set Over-ride Site/Behavior to 1.

This may not be the source of original case finding (for example, if a case is identified through a pathology laboratory report review and all source documents used to abstract the case are from the physician’s office, code this item 4).","The code in this field can be used to explain why information may be incomplete on a tumor. For example, death certificate only cases have unknown values for many data items, so one may want to exclude them from some analyses. The field also is used to monitor the success of non-hospital case reporting and follow-back mechanisms. All population-based registries should have some death certificate-only cases where no hospital admission was involved, but too high a percentage can imply both shortcomings in case-finding and that follow-back to uncover missed hospital reports was not complete.

**Coding Instructions**

Code in the following priority order: 1, 2, 8, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7. This is a change to reflect the addition of codes 2 and 8 and to prioritize laboratory reports over nursing home reports. The source facilities included in the previous code 1 (hospital inpatient and outpatient) are split between codes 1, 2, and 8.

This data item is intended to indicate the completeness of information available to the abstractor. Reports from health plans (e.g., Kaiser, Veterans Administration, military facilities) in which all diagnostic and treatment information is maintained centrally and is available to the abstractor are expected to be at least as complete as reports for hospital inpatients, which is why these sources are grouped with inpatients and given the code with the highest priority.

Sources coded with '2' usually have complete information on the cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment.

Sources coded with '8' would include, but would not be limited to, outpatient surgery and nuclear medicine services. A physician's office that calls itself a surgery center should be coded as a physician's office. Surgery centers are equipped and staffed to perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia. If a physician's office calls itself a surgery center, but cannot perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia, code as a physician office.",,,**Codes**,1-8,,digits,,,,,,,,,,

Sequence Number 00 indicates that the person has only one malignant neoplasm in his lifetime (regardless of hospital registry reference date). Sequence Number 01 indicates the first of two or more malignant neoplasms, while 02 indicates the second of two or more malignant neoplasms, and so on. Because the time period of Sequence Number is a person’s lifetime, reportable neoplasms not included in the hospital registry are also allotted a sequence number. For example, a registry may contain a single record for a patient with a sequence number of 02 because the first reportable neoplasm occurred before the hospital registry’s reference date. Similarly, Sequence Number 60 indicates the patient has only one non-malignant neoplasm, and Sequence Number 61 represents the first of multiple non-malignant neoplasms.

**Coding Instructions and Summary of USPS Guidelines.**

*   This field is intended to store street address information for the patient’s physical, residential address. All efforts should be made to find the patient’s true street address and postal code, including reviewing relevant sources outside the medical record if available. A PO Box mailing address should only be recorded when no other address information is available in the medical record and no other information sources are available.
*   If the patient has multiple tumors, address at diagnosis may be different for each tumor.
*   Do not update this item if the patient’s residential address changes. Store updated address information in the affiliated current address data items. Only update based on improved information on the residential address at time of diagnosis. For instance, it is appropriate to correct an address during the geocoding or consolidation process.
*   Refer to the latest _STORE_ for residency rules.
*   Additional address information such as facility, nursing home, name of apartment complex, or a PO Box used for mailing purposes, should be entered in Addr At Dx--Supplementl \[2335\].
*   U.S. addresses should conform to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Postal Addressing Standards. These standards are referenced in USPS Publication 28, Postal Addressing Standards. The current USPS Pub. 28 may be found and downloaded here: \<[http://pe.usps.gov/cpim/ftp/pubs/Pub28/pub28.pdf](http://pe.usps.gov/cpim/ftp/pubs/Pub28/pub28.pdf)\>.
*   The address should be fully spelled out with standardized use of abbreviations and punctuation per USPS postal addressing standards (USPS Pub. 28, available at link above). Mixed case allowed.
*   Canadian addresses should conform to the Canada Postal Guide. The current Canadian Postal Address Standards may be found here: \<[https://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/PGaddress-e.pdf](https://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/PGaddress-e.pdf)\>.
*   Punctuation marks should be avoided, except when punctuation is necessary to convey the meaning. Punctuation normally is limited to periods when the period carries meaning (e.g., 39.2 RD), slashes for fractional addresses (e.g., 101 1/2 Main St), and hyphens when the hyphen carries meaning (e.g., 289-01 Montgomery Ave). Use of the pound sign (#) to designate address units should be avoided whenever possible. The preferred notation is as follows: 102 Main St Apt 101. If a pound sign is used, there must be a space between the pound sign and the secondary number (e.g., 425 Flower Blvd # 72).
*   Abbreviations should be limited to those recognized by USPS standard abbreviations, these include, but are not limited, to the list below: (A complete list of recognized street abbreviations is provided in Appendix C of USPS Pub. 28 available at link above):

By having a second street address field to hold address information, the registry can look up and store the street address and not lose the facility name due to a shortage of space.   
  
The presence of a second street address field to hold additional address information also aids in follow-up. For instance, Addr At DX--No & Street [2330] should contain a street address only. However, it is important to retain any known PO Box information when linking for cohort studies or patient contact studies. Retaining facility name can also help correct errors in Addr At DX--No & Street [2330] or assist with geocoding or consolidation. Additionally, researchers can use this field to verify if geographic areas of high risk are driven by location of facilities, such as jails, nursing homes, or homeless shelters.  
  
   
**Instructions for Coding**   
  
* Record the name of the place or facility (for example nursing home, apartment complex, prison/jail or group home) of the patient’s residence when the tumor was diagnosed. Do not use this item for information stored in other address items such as Addr At DX--NO & Street [2330].
* Record a full residential PO Box here (including city & zip code) or other non-physical, residential mailing address here.
* Record HOMELESS here when the street address used is a shelter or diagnosing facility for persons with no usual residence.
* If the patient has multiple tumors, address at diagnosis supplemental may be different for each tumor.
* Do not update this item if the patient’s residential address changes. Store updated address information in the affiliated current address data items. Only update based on improved information on the residential address at time of diagnosis. For instance, it is appropriate to correct supplemental address during the geocoding or consolidation process.

Canadian addresses should conform to the _Canada Postal Guide_. The current Canadian Postal Address standards may be found at the following website: \<[http://www.canadapost.ca](http://www.canadapost.ca)\>.","“Current address” can be used to measure the regional “cancer burden” (cost, medical care needs), especially in major retirement regions. Sometimes central registries carry out follow-up by contacting the patients via letter or telephone calls to ascertain their vital status. The most current reported address and telephone number are needed. This information also is useful for conducting interview studies.

Addresses that are formatted to conform to USPS _Postal Addressing Standards_ can be more properly geocoded by GIS software and vendors to the correct census tract. The USPS Standards also address a number of issues that are problematic in producing precise addresses, including the use of punctuation, abbreviations, and proper placement of address elements, such as street direction, apartment and suite numbers, and unusual addressing situations. Spanish-language addresses also are covered by the USPS Standard.

The IG also specifies transmission of other data documented in the EHR as part of the care of the patient which are also standardized, but are not routinely collected by cancer registries in the same way or as discrete items. Examples of these are procedures, medications, smoking, and vital signs (i.e., height, weight, BMI). Currently, software tools such as CDC’s eMaRC Plus parse some EHR elements and map or translate these fields to NAACCR items. However, some data are not able to be mapped to discrete items. This new proposed field will allow central cancer registries to collect information from the EHR and map these data in the NAACCR record layout so that they can be included in the central registry database and be available to enhance surveillance data.","Central cancer registries may wish to integrate EHR data, which are not already in the NAACCR record layout, into their databases.

Tumor Record Number is assigned to each of a patient’s tumors sequentially in the order in which the tumor record is created by the central registry. A patient’s first tumor record is assigned Tumor Record Number 01. Tumor Record Number is assigned to each of a patient’s tumors sequentially in the order in which the tumor record is created by the central registry and may not match timing based on Diagnosis Date. 

For example, the first tumor created in the database is diagnosed 12/2022 and is assigned Tumor Record Number = 01; the registry later learns the patient had a separate tumor diagnosed 5/2020, this is the second tumor created in the database and assigned Tumor Record Number = 02.

If a tumor is deleted or replaced, the Tumor Record Number associated with the deleted case is not reused.

For example, Patient has three cancers, Tumor Record Numbers = 01, 02 and 03. Upon review, it is determined that the cancer assigned Tumor Record Number 02 is actually a recurrence of 01 and it is deleted.

Patient now has two cancers, Tumor Record Numbers = 01 and 03. If a new tumor is created for this patient, 02 will never be reused and Tumor Record Number will be assigned as 04.

Unlike Sequence Number, behavior code has no effect on how Tumor Record Number is assigned.","It is important to be able to track a specific de-identified tumor over time for linkage purposes. Sequence Number—Central \[380\] and Sequence Number—Hospital \[560\] can change as more information becomes available about a case (i.e., diagnosis of a second primary changes sequence number 00 to 01, or discovery of a prior diagnosis may change sequence number 02 to 03). Sequence numbers are also reused if a tumor is deleted. Therefore, sequence number cannot be used to uniquely link a specific tumor. Tumor Record Number, together with Patient ID Number, provide the continuity to uniquely identify a specific tumor over time.",,,,01-99,,digits,,,,Revised,,Revised; NPCR Revised 8/23/2023,Revised,Revised 6/20/2024,Revised 6/20/2024,

Clinically, information regarding the Pons is very important, especially for pediatric cases. A schema discriminator is necessary to distinguish between the pons and other subsites of the brain stem.","The pons site is the third most common site for pediatric brain tumors and there is currently no way to identify tumors that occur in this site. Surgery is too dangerous for these types of tumors. Needle biopsies are also dangerous and extremely rare. Without pathology specimens, accurate histology is elusive making accurate incidence not possible. A cascade of implications results without accurate incidence including support for drug development.",,,,"1, 2, 8, 9, Blank",,numeric,"**Note 1:** This SSDI is effective for diagnosis years 2024+
